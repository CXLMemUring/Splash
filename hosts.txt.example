# Example MPI hostfile for CXL litmus tests
# Replace these with your actual host names or IP addresses
# Format: hostname[:slots]

# Example 1: Using hostnames
host1 slots=1
host2 slots=1

# Example 2: Using IP addresses
# 192.168.1.10 slots=1
# 192.168.1.11 slots=1

# Example 3: With specific network interface
# host1-cxl slots=1
# host2-cxl slots=1

# Notes:
# - You need exactly 2 hosts for these litmus tests
# - Make sure the hosts are connected via CXL switch
# - Ensure MPI is properly configured on both hosts
# - Passwordless SSH should be set up between hosts
