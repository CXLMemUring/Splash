# PGAS Configuration for SPEC CPU MCF Benchmark
# =============================================
# MCF is a memory-intensive benchmark for vehicle scheduling
# Characteristics:
#   - High cache miss rate (MPKI 2-3)
#   - Large working set (~1.7GB for 64-bit)
#   - Irregular pointer-chasing access patterns
#   - Two critical 2GB data objects dominate performance
#
# Tuning Strategy:
#   - Keep critical objects in local DRAM/CXL
#   - Use block partitioning for spatial locality
#   - Maximize prefetch effectiveness

# Node configuration
local_node_id=0
num_nodes=2

# Node addresses (IP:Port:CXL_Base:CXL_Size)
# MCF needs ~2GB per critical object, allocate 4GB per node
node0=127.0.0.1:5000:0x0:4294967296
node1=127.0.0.1:5001:0x0:4294967296

# MCF-specific tuning parameters
# ==============================

# Memory affinity: LOCAL preferred to reduce CXL latency impact
# Research shows relocating critical objects to local DRAM reduces
# slowdown from 13% to 2%
memory_affinity=local

# Partitioning: BLOCK for better spatial locality
# MCF has struct node/arc with rearranged elements for cache efficiency
partition_scheme=block

# Prefetch hint: AGGRESSIVE
# MCF benefits from prefetching due to predictable struct traversal
prefetch_mode=aggressive

# Consistency model: RELAXED
# MCF is read-heavy with infrequent updates
consistency=relaxed

# Cache line padding: ENABLED
# Reduces false sharing in struct node/arc
cache_line_align=true

# Batch remote operations to amortize CXL latency
batch_size=64

# Thread configuration
# MCF is mostly single-threaded but uses OpenMP for some loops
num_threads=1
