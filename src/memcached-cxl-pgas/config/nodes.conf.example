# Node configurations
# Format: nodeX=hostname:port:cxl_base_address:cxl_size
#   - hostname: IP address or hostname
#   - port: PGAS communication port
#   - cxl_base_address: Base address of CXL memory (hex)
#   - cxl_size: Size of CXL memory in bytes

# Node 0 - First host
node0=192.168.1.10:5000:0x100000000:1073741824

# Node 1 - Second host
node1=192.168.1.11:5000:0x100000000:1073741824

# Example with more nodes:
# node2=192.168.1.12:5000:0x100000000:1073741824
# node3=192.168.1.13:5000:0x100000000:1073741824

# Notes:
# - CXL base address can be found using: cat /proc/iomem | grep CXL
# - Or for DAX devices: cat /sys/class/dax/dax*/resource
# - Ensure all nodes have the same CXL memory size for balanced distribution
# - Communication port must be open in firewall
